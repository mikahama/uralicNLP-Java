# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of uralicNLP is supported for security updates. On the other hand, I am trying to make changes as backwards compatible as possible so that the latest version should work with code using a prior version.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, you can either open an issue or send me an email to mika.hamalainen@helsinki.fi. Please describe the vulnerability as clearly as possible with an example exploit. Feel free to patch the code and open up a pull request as well.
